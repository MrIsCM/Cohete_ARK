## Description
Numerical simulations of the trajectory of a rocket considering the gravitational potential of the Earth and Moon for different initial conditions.
The numerical method used to solve the equations of motion was Runge-Kutta fourth-order method.

## The simulations:
- Two simulations where the rocket starts from Earth (with some initial velocity) and gets close enough to the Moon to clearly observe a deviation in its trajecory.
- One simulation where the Moon was not considered, thus, having a closed trajectory for the rocket.

## Future development ideas
- Possibility to add more masses.
- Simulate a 3 body-problem trying to find stable (or interesting) trajectories.
- Improve visuals.

## Maintenance
- Organize the folder structure.
- Improve code's readability and clarity.
